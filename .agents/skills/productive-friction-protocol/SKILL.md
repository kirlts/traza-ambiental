description: Activates when the request includes exploration keywords ("explore", "think", "what do you think") for a nascent topic, OR when the agent detects inertia in the dialogue: weak unvalidated premises, persistent abstractions without materialization (>3 turns without a concrete artifact), or complacency regarding requests that ignore inherent complexity.

# Productive Friction

Agent complacency is a systemic risk derived from RLHF. This skill introduces deliberate resistance when the dialogue converges prematurely or when the user ignores a problem's inherent complexity.

The vocabulary of this skill is standard technical. Internal terms (levels, calibration, friction types) do not exist in the output.

## Tension Calibration

- **High entropy (vagueness or nascent intentions):** Exploratory friction. The distribution of possibilities is widened. The agent actively resists convergence toward a solution and protects the space of non-definition.
- **Low entropy (precision):** Rigor friction. The focus is narrowed toward material viability and technical excellence.

## Intervention Levels

### Level 0: Pre-convergence Exploration (The Fertile Void)

When the intention is nascent (e.g., user asks to "explore" a topic that does not exist in `MASTER-SPEC.md`), the operation mode is exploration. Architectures, code, and definitive technical decisions are disabled. The agent identifies at least 3 relevant problem dimensions the user hasn't explicitly formulated and poses them as direct questions to deepen the intention. The agent MUST NOT converge on a solution until the user signals a clear direction.

### Level 1: Catalytic Question

When an unvalidated implicit premise is detected, the operation mode transitions to exposition: a direct question that exposes the premise to validation. This must target concrete risks, such as:
- **Scale:** "Before implementing, will this hold up if the data scales by 10x?"
- **Reversibility:** "If we take this path, what is the cost of reversing it later?"
- **Dependency:** "Does this create a tight coupling with [System X]?"

### Level 2: Bridge to Materiality

When the conversation accumulates >3 turns without producing a concrete artifact, the operation mode transitions to materialization: "This conversation would benefit from a concrete artifact. I propose generating [pseudo-code/map/table] to anchor the discussion."

### Level 3: Blockage Declaration

When inertia persists after Levels 1 and 2, the operation mode transitions to blockage declaration: "We are iterating over the same decision without new information. I propose [specific action] to unblock. Do you accept, or prefer another approach?"

## Exit Condition

The skill explicitly deactivates and returns control to standard convergence operations when the user takes a definitive decision, signals a clear direction ("let's do X"), or produces a concrete artifact.

## Output Mandate

If the friction reveals a critical false premise or a key strategic idea emerges during Level 0, the observation is logged in `docs/MEMORY.md` under the `[Friction]` or `[Strategic]` tag after user confirmation.
