# Working Document: Derive: [Subject Name]

> **GLOBAL RULES AND INVIOLABLE LIMITS**:
> 1. **MANDATORY:** You are an automaton. You will execute this PHASE BY PHASE, without skipping steps or combining them. Each Phase MUST be written in a SEPARATE file operation. You are FORBIDDEN from writing multiple phases in a single tool call.
> 2. **LANGUAGE MANDATE:** While these instructions are in English, ALL GENERATED CONTENT (Reasoning, Tables, Checks) MUST BE WRITTEN IN THE REPOSITORY'S PREDOMINANT LOCALE (e.g., Spanish).
> 3. **COVERAGE PRESERVATION RULE:** You are strictly forbidden from curtailing the check count. Generating exactly "1 check per category" is a statistical failure (Dimensionality Collapse). You MUST generate multiple specific variations, failure states, and edge cases per category. The rigorous application dictates a MINIMUM of 10 atomic checks per Actor, with NO global maximum ceiling. Do not manipulate the count.
> 4. **CHECKPOINT ANCHOR:** Before initiating any Phase, output exactly: `<!-- CHECKPOINT: Phase [N] started at [timestamp] -->`
> 5. **GATES (CoT INVERSION):** Do NOT skip any `⛔ GATE` table. You MUST write your reasoning in the `Empirical Reasoning (CoT)` column BEFORE generating the final `Status` (✅ / ❌ / ⚠️). A Status of ❌ halts the algorithm. The column order in every gate table is intentional: Reasoning FIRST, Status LAST.
>    - *ANTI-PATTERN:* Deciding the status mentally and then writing a justification that matches. This is confirmation bias. You must genuinely interrogate the output.
>    - *ANTI-PATTERN:* Writing a single sentence like "Looks good" or "Confirmed" as reasoning. Reasoning must demonstrate empirical engagement with the data.
> 6. **CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS (PRIMACY DUPLICATION; repeated at end of file for Recency anchoring):**
>    - Every check uses taxonomy `[ACTOR.CAT.NN.VER]` with verificability suffix (.LLM, .HUM, .MIX).
>    - Every check is atomic: ONE action, ONE result, binary pass/fail.
>    - The MECE audit is non-negotiable: overlaps are eliminated, gaps are filled.
>    - The final deliverable traces back to VERIFICATION.md.

## Phase 0: Input Classification & System Identity

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Extract Domain Knowledge (technical facts), Author-Provided Checks (explicit acceptance behavior provided by the human), Platform Constraints, and User Overrides. Compress the System Identity into ONE sentence answering: What it does, for whom, and why.

DISCRIMINATION TEST: Checks vs Overrides:
  Does the user's statement describe a PROPERTY of the system that can be verified (e.g., "must support 10k concurrent users")? → Author-Provided Check. It will become a verifiable check.
  Does the user's statement describe HOW THIS ALGORITHM should behave (e.g., "focus only on the frontend", "ignore the API layer")? → User Override. It modifies scope.
  If ambiguous, classify as Author-Provided Check. It is safer to generate a verifiable check from it than to absorb it silently as a scope restriction. -->

## Phase 1: Actor Discovery

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Identify ALL entities that interact with, influence, or are affected by the system. Run every Discovery Probe below against the input.

CRITICAL RULES:
  - You must discover actors from the INPUT (code, docs, config), not invent plausible-sounding ones.
  - Each actor must be a distinct entity; not a synonym or subset of another.
  - An actor may satisfy multiple Discovery Probes. Do NOT force a single-probe classification.

ANTI-PATTERN: Listing only the obvious actors (e.g., only "User" and "Database"). Run ALL five probes.
ANTI-PATTERN: Stopping at exactly 3 actors because the minimum is met. Software systems typically have 4-8 distinct actors. -->

### Discovery Probes
<!-- These five questions decompose ALL possible relationships an entity can have with a software system. They are search beams, not classification labels. -->

| Probe | Question |
|---|---|
| Value reception | Who receives output, rendered content, API responses, or processed data from this system? |
| Resource provision | Who provides infrastructure, data stores, services, or configuration this system depends on? |
| State observation | Who monitors, logs, audits, or passively observes this system's state? |
| External constraint | What external dependency, runtime, specification, or platform does this system run within but cannot control? |
| Mediation | What connects, routes, or bridges between system components or between the system and its consumers? |

### Derivation
**Verbs found in input:** [pending]
**Subjects/Objects found in input:** [pending]

### Discovery Probe Results
<!-- MANDATORY: Run each probe and record what it yields BEFORE assembling the Actor List. -->
| Probe | Entities Found |
|---|---|
| Value reception | [pending; who receives output?] |
| Resource provision | [pending; who provides resources?] |
| State observation | [pending; who observes state?] |
| External constraint | [pending; what constrains the system?] |

**⛔ GATE 1**
| ID | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|
| G1-PROBES | [Write: List what each of the 5 Discovery Probes yielded. Were any probes skipped? Did any probe yield zero entities; if so, justify why that relationship genuinely does not exist for this system.] | ☐ |

| G1-VALUE-RECEPTION | [Write: Did you identify at least one entity that receives value or output from the system?] | ☐ |
| G1-VOCABULARY | [Write: Are the actor names specific to this system's domain? Would a developer reading only the actor names understand the system's architecture?] | ☐ |

## Phase 2: Promise Matrix

<!-- INSTRUCTION - CATEGORY DICTIONARY
For EACH Actor above, complete the matrix based on:
- Availability (AV): The actor can access the system when requested. It arrives.
- Functionality (FN): The system performs the state change or action the actor expects.
- Correctness (CR): The output or data matches the truth/domain rules precisely.
- Integrity (IN): The state remains consistent across time/failures (no corruption).
- Resilience (RS): The system degrades gracefully or blocks the actor if abused.

Generate MULTIPLE promises per category. A single promise per category is Dimensionality Collapse. Each promise must have a concrete failure mechanism; How can this promise be broken?

ANTI-PATTERN: Writing abstract, unfalsifiable promises ("The system should work well", "Data should be correct"). Every promise must describe a specific, observable state.
ANTI-PATTERN: Generating exactly 2 promises per category across all actors to hit the minimum of 10. The minimum is a FLOOR.
ANTI-PATTERN: Copy-pasting the same promise structure across actors with minor word changes. Each actor has a UNIQUE relationship with the system. -->

### [Actor Name]
| Category | Promise | Failure Mechanism | Falsable? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Availability | [pending] | [pending] | ☐ |
| Functionality | [pending] | [pending] | ☐ |
| Correctness | [pending] | [pending] | ☐ |
| Integrity | [pending] | [pending] | ☐ |
| Resilience | [pending] | [pending] | ☐ |

<!-- Repeat this table for EACH actor independently -->

**⛔ GATE 2**
| ID | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|
| G2-CELLS | [Write: Count total cells across all actors. Are there any empty or placeholder cells? List any gaps found.] | ☐ |
| G2-FALSABILITY | [Write: For each promise marked as falsable, can you articulate the YES/NO test? Pick 3 random promises and write their tests here.] | ☐ |
| G2-TAUTOLOGY-PURGE | [Write: Are any promises tautological ("X should do X")? List any found and rewrite them.] | ☐ |
| G2-THRESHOLD | [Write: Count total promises derived. Count number of actors. Calculate: Total ≥ (N_Actors × 10)? Show the math. If NO, STOP and expand the matrix before proceeding.] | ☐ |
| G2-VOCABULARY | [Write: Scan all promise text. Is the terminology consistent across actors? If one actor uses "request" and another uses "petition" for the same concept, normalize.] | ☐ |

## Phase 3: Observables & Verificability Classification

<!-- INSTRUCTION: For every Promise defined in Phase 2, define HOW it is observed from the OUTSIDE AND classify WHO is the best-qualified entity to verify it.
Format: Action → Expected Result → Verificador
The observation must be EXTERNAL; it describes what a verifier would see, not what happens internally.

VERIFIABILITY CLASSIFICATION: The Verificador column classifies which entity is best qualified to verify the promise in ideal conditions. This classification describes the NATURE OF THE VERIFICATION TASK, not a preference.

  🤖 (.LLM) = An automated tool is the best-qualified verifier (test E2E, linter, script, crawler, static analysis, etc.)
  🧑 (.HUM) = A human is the best-qualified verifier (subjective judgment, aesthetic perception, organizational context, real-world integration, strategic decisions)
  🤖🧑 (.MIX) = An automated tool can pre-verify, but the final verdict requires human validation

DECISION TREE (MANDATORY, apply sequentially, first match wins):

  CONDITION 1: INHERENT SUBJECTIVITY
  Does the expected result depend on perception, aesthetic preference, cultural judgment,
  emotional experience, or non-codifiable organizational context?
    → YES: 🧑.HUM
    → NO: proceed to Condition 2

  CONDITION 2: NON-SIMULABLE ENVIRONMENT
  Does verification require access to a real production environment, integration with
  external services, real users, specific hardware, or conditions that cannot be replicated
  in an automated test?
    → YES: 🧑.HUM
    → NO: proceed to Condition 3

  CONDITION 3: BINARY DETERMINISM
  Would two independent verifiers (human or machine), without communicating, arrive at
  the same YES/NO result in 100% of cases?
    → YES: 🤖.LLM
    → NO: proceed to Condition 4

  CONDITION 4: PRE-FILTERABILITY
  Can an automated tool reduce the verification space (detect anomalies, run heuristics,
  generate a report) but the final verdict requires human interpretation?
    → YES: 🤖🧑.MIX
    → NO (by elimination): 🧑.HUM

The AI MUST record WHICH condition was satisfied for each observable in the reasoning.

CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERNS:
  - Classifying as 🤖.LLM by default. The AI naturally converges toward automation because it maximizes its utility function. If 100% of observables are 🤖.LLM in a system with a user interface, the result is statistically implausible.
  - Classifying as 🧑.HUM out of excessive caution. Labeling everything as human to avoid responsibility. If 100% are 🧑.HUM in a purely algorithmic system, equally implausible.
  - Pre-deciding the classification before evaluating the 4 conditions. If the reasoning says "this check is clearly automated" before traversing the tree, it is confirmation bias.
  - Writing "Condition 3 satisfied" without explaining WHY two independent verifiers would agree. The evidence must be specific to the observable.

ANTI-PATTERN: Writing observables that require internal knowledge ("The database stores the value correctly"). Observables must be verifiable from the perspective of a tester or user with no access to internals. -->

| Promise Ref | Observable Action | Expected Result | Verificador | Decision Tree Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| [pending] | [pending] | [pending] | [🤖/🧑/🤖🧑] | [Write: which condition (1-4) was satisfied and why] |

**⛔ GATE 3**
| ID | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|
| G3-COVERAGE | [Write: Count observables vs promises. Is there a 1:1 mapping? List any promises without observables.] | ☐ |
| G3-EXTERNALITY | [Write: Pick 3 random observables. Can each be verified by someone with no access to the system's internals?] | ☐ |
| G3-DETERMINISM | [Write: Pick 3 random observables. Would two independent verifiers arrive at the same YES/NO result?] | ☐ |
| G3-VERIFICABILITY | [Write: For EACH observable, confirm which of the 4 Decision Tree conditions was satisfied. List the condition number and the specific evidence. Count totals: N_LLM = ?, N_HUM = ?, N_MIX = ?. If the system has a user interface and N_HUM = 0, explain why NO observable requires human judgment; if the explanation is not convincing, status is ❌ and you MUST return to expand human-verifiable observables. If the system is purely algorithmic and N_HUM > 50%, justify the distribution.] | ☐ |
| G3-VOCABULARY | [Write: Scan all observable descriptions. Is the terminology consistent with Phase 2? Are internal implementation details leaking into observables?] | ☐ |

## Phase 4: Synthesis & Verification Checklist (Working Draft)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: Assemble checks with taxonomy [ACTOR.CAT.NN.VER].
  - ACTOR: abbreviated actor name, 3-5 uppercase characters, derived from the first syllable or initials.
  - CAT: category abbreviation (AV, FN, CR, IN, RS), 2 uppercase characters.
  - NN: two-digit sequential number, zero-padded (01, 02...).
  - VER: verificability suffix; one of: LLM, HUM, MIX. Inherited from the observable's Verificador classification in Phase 3.
  Define all abbreviations ONCE in the key table below, then reuse consistently.

  The emoji (🤖, 🧑, or 🤖🧑) is placed as a PREFIX before the check ID for visual scannability.
  The suffix (.LLM, .HUM, .MIX) is part of the ID for textual traceability (search, filters, scripts).

Rules:
  - Compound checks MUST be decomposed. One action, one result.
  - Each check must be self-contained; understandable without reading the working document.
  - Each check INHERITS its verificability classification from its parent observable in Phase 3. If a compound check was decomposed, re-evaluate the Decision Tree for each atomic part.

ANTI-PATTERN: Writing checks that require context from the working document to be understood.
ANTI-PATTERN: Merging two observables into one check to reduce count.
ANTI-PATTERN: Using inconsistent abbreviations for the same actor across different checks.
ANTI-PATTERN: Assigning a verificability suffix that contradicts the parent observable's classification without re-applying the Decision Tree. -->

### Abbreviation Key
| Full Name | Abbreviation | Type |
|---|---|---|
| [pending] | [pending] | Actor / Category |
| Verifiable by AI/automated tool | LLM | Verifier |
| Requires human verification | HUM | Verifier |
| Pre-verifiable by AI, final human validation | MIX | Verifier |

### Checklist Draft
- 🧑 `[ACTOR.CAT.NN.HUM]` Action → Expected Result. *(Promise: ...)*
- 🤖 `[ACTOR.CAT.NN.LLM]` Action → Expected Result. *(Promise: ...)*
- 🤖🧑 `[ACTOR.CAT.NN.MIX]` Action → Expected Result. *(Promise: ...)*

### Atomicity Verification
<!-- INSTRUCTION: For EACH check, verify four properties independently. Do NOT batch-verify.

ANTI-PATTERN: Marking all checks as ATOMIC without examining each one. The verdict column must be filled ONLY after all boolean columns are evaluated. -->

| Check ID | Singular Action? | Singular Result? | Implicit Compound? | Coherent Verifier? | Verdict (ATOMIC/COMPOUND) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [ID] | [Write: Does this check contain exactly ONE verb/action?] | [Write: Does this check describe exactly ONE observable outcome?] | [Write: Could this check be split into two checks that verify different things?] | [Write: Does the .LLM/.HUM/.MIX suffix match the Decision Tree applied to this check's parent observable? If the check was decomposed from a compound, was the Decision Tree re-evaluated for each atomic part?] | [pending; fill ONLY after all columns] |

**⛔ GATE 4**
| ID | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|
| G4-ATOMICITY | [Write: How many checks were marked COMPOUND? Were ALL of them decomposed? List the original compound checks and their decompositions.] | ☐ |
| G4-DENSITY-PER-ACTOR | [Write: For EACH actor, count the checks. List: Actor1=N, Actor2=N, Actor3=N... Does EVERY actor have ≥10? If ANY actor has <10, STOP. Return to Phase 2 and expand that actor's promise matrix. Do NOT proceed.] | ☐ |

---
## Phase 5: MECE Audit (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: 
ME Audit: Compare checks that appear similar. Are they verifying exactly the same state, or different facets?
CE Audit: Are there gaps in coverage? Does the matrix lack tests for edge cases, failure modes, or boundary conditions?

ANTI-PATTERN: Declaring "no overlaps found" without examining specific pairs. You must list the pairs you compared.
ANTI-PATTERN: Declaring "no gaps found" without examining the coverage matrix cell by cell. -->

### ME Pairs Examined
| Pair (ID-a ↔ ID-b) | Same Promise? | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| [pending; list SPECIFIC pairs you compared] | [Write: What do they share? What differentiates them?] | [pending; fill ONLY after analyzing the pair] |

### Coverage Matrix
| Actor | AV | FN | CR | IN | RS |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| [name] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [count] | [count] |

**⛔ GATE 5**
| ID | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|
| G5-ME-PAIRS | [Write: How many pairs did you examine? List the most ambiguous pair and explain why they are or are not duplicates.] | ☐ |
| G5-CE-MATRIX | [Write: Examine the coverage matrix. Are there any cells with 0 checks? If so, is the gap justified or does it indicate a missing promise?] | ☐ |
| G5-CE-NO-GAPS | [Write: Consider the system holistically. Is there any requirement, constraint, or behavior mentioned in the input that is NOT covered by any check?] | ☐ |
| G5-AUDIT-DELTA | [Write: Did this audit result in any additions, removals, or modifications? List them.] | ☐ |
| G5-POST-MECE-DENSITY | [Write: After all ME removals from this audit, re-count checks per actor. List: Actor1=N, Actor2=N... Does EVERY actor still have ≥10? If ANY actor dropped below 10 due to duplicate removal, STOP. Return to Phase 2, generate replacement promises for the removed duplicates, and propagate through Phases 3-4 before proceeding.] | ☐ |

---
## GATE 6: Self-Verification Audit (Terminal)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: This is the terminal gate. You are auditing your OWN output against immutable invariants.

EXECUTION SEQUENCE (MANDATORY):
  1. You MUST have already generated `[subject]_checklist.md` using the output template BEFORE reaching this gate.
  2. STOP writing the working document.
  3. Open `[subject]_checklist.md`; the DELIVERABLE, not the working draft above.
  4. Count its actual contents: actors, checks per actor, terminology used.
  5. Record your findings below.
  6. If any invariant fails, remediate before proceeding to integration.
  This gate audits the DELIVERABLE, not the working document.

ANTI-PATTERN: Treating this as a rubber-stamp. If you find a failure, you MUST remediate; not rationalize.
ANTI-PATTERN: Writing "All actors have ≥10 checks" without listing the actual counts. Show your work.
ANTI-PATTERN: Filling this gate by referencing Phase 4 counts instead of counting the deliverable directly. The deliverable is the source of truth. -->

| ID | Invariant | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|---|
| G6-ACTOR-COUNT | ≥3 actors identified | [Write: List every actor in the deliverable. Count them.] | ☐ |
| G6-DENSITY | ≥10 checks per actor (NO EXCEPTIONS) | [Write: For EACH actor, count the checks in the deliverable. Format: Actor1=N, Actor2=N... If ANY <10, status is ❌ and you MUST return to Phase 2.] | ☐ |
| G6-ATOMICITY | Every check has ONE action and ONE result | [Write: Sample 5 random checks. For each, identify the single action and single result. Flag any that contain conjunctions (and/or/also).] | ☐ |
| G6-MECE | No duplicates, no gaps | [Write: Were all ME pairs resolved? Were all CE gaps closed?] | ☐ |
| G6-FALSABILITY | Every check is binary (pass/fail) | [Write: Pick 3 random checks. For each, articulate the exact binary test. If any check requires subjective interpretation, flag it.] | ☐ |
| G6-HUMAN-CHECKS | Verificability distribution reflects system nature | [Write: Count checks by verificador type IN THE DELIVERABLE (not the working document): Total .LLM = ?, Total .HUM = ?, Total .MIX = ?. For EACH .HUM and .MIX check, list its ID and the Decision Tree condition (1-4) that justified its classification. CROSS-REFERENCE: Does the system have a user interface? If YES and .HUM = 0: status is ❌. Does the system integrate with external services? If YES and .HUM + .MIX = 0: status is ❌. Is the system purely algorithmic with no human-facing output? If YES and .HUM > 50%: justify or status is ❌.] | ☐ |
| G6-ALGORITHM | All 6 phases and 7 gates executed sequentially | [Write: List each checkpoint anchor found in this document. Count: Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4, Phase 5 = 6 phases. Gate 0, Gate 1, Gate 2, Gate 3, Gate 4, Gate 5, Gate 6 = 7 gates.] | ☐ |
| G6-OVERRIDES | All user overrides respected | [Write: List each override from Phase 0. For each, confirm how it was applied. If no overrides, write "No overrides specified."] | ☐ |

**HARD FAILURE PROTOCOL:** If G6-DENSITY is ❌, return to Phase 2, expand the deficient actor(s), propagate through Phases 3-5, regenerate the deliverable, and re-execute GATE 6.
**HUMAN-CHECKS FAILURE PROTOCOL:** If G6-HUMAN-CHECKS is ❌, return to Phase 3, re-evaluate the Decision Tree for the flagged observables, propagate through Phase 4, regenerate the deliverable, and re-execute GATE 6.

## ⛔ GATE 7: Anti-Slop Verification (Post-Deliverable)

<!-- INSTRUCTION: This gate verifies that the deliverable does not contain AI-generated filler, corporate-motivational copy, or RLHF fingerprints. It operates by heuristic pattern detection, not semantic judgment. -->

| ID | Pattern Category | Detection Heuristic | Empirical Reasoning (CoT) | Status (✅/❌) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| G7-RLHF-FILLER | RLHF transition fillers | Scan deliverable for: «It's worth noting that», «Cabe destacar que», «Es importante señalar», «En este contexto», «Por otro lado» | [Write: List any instances found. If none, write "Zero instances."] | ☐ |
| G7-NEG-PARALLELISM | Negative parallelisms | Scan for: «not just X, but Y», «no solo X, sino Y», «more than just» | [Write: List any instances found.] | ☐ |
| G7-CORPORATE-COPY | Corporate-motivational copy | Scan for: «cutting-edge», «seamless», «innovative», «unlock», «empower», «transform your», «leverage» | [Write: List any instances found.] | ☐ |
