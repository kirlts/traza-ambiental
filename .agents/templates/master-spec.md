> [One-line project description]

## §1. Project Identity

**Purpose:** [What it does, for whom, and why it matters. Not as an elevator pitch; as an intention statement that a contributor can use to make decisions without asking.]

**Name:** [Project Name]

**Domain:** [Problem category: e.g., "Data Security", "Education", "RegTech"]

**Problem it solves:** [What friction, inefficiency, or concrete need this project attacks. A person unfamiliar with the project should be able to understand the pain it alleviates.]

**Direct beneficiary:** [Who receives concrete value from this project. Not "users" in the abstract; the specific entity whose situation improves.]

**Indirect beneficiary:** [If applicable: who benefits as a secondary consequence.]

**What it IS NOT:** [What this project does NOT attempt to be. This protects the scope from unintended expansion. If there are no scope constraints, write: "No defined scope constraints."]

## §3. Technical Stack

| Layer | Technology | Justification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Frontend | [e.g., React + Vite] | [why this and not another] |
| Backend | [e.g., Zero-backend] | [why] |
| Data | [e.g., IndexedDB] | [why] |

## §4. Constraints (Inviolable Boundaries)

> These constraints override any other decision. They are the lines that must not be crossed.

## §5. Agreed Trade-offs

> Decisions where one quality was sacrificed in favor of another, with the explicit reason.

| Trade-off | In favor of | Against | Justification |
